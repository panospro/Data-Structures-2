# Data-Structures-2-Graphics

## It's a graphical representation of Data Structures 1 project about a Theseus and the Minotaur using java.
## The graphical part is inside the class MyFrame

### *Library used*: **Swing**  
which is suitable for creating various GUI stuff in java. It includes several classes that were found useful such as:
* JButton
* JComboBox
* JFrame
* JLabel
* JOptionPane
* JPanel
* JSlider

### Notes:  
* The code had 1-2 bugs:
  * Theseus sometimes goes through walls 
  * He doesnt prefer going for the objective but that's not a graphical bug, it's from the previous projects, where the automated choice of the player is handled wrong 

* The other classes (e.g. Board) have a few changes from the previous ones
